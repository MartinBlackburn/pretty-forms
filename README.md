Make those pesky select, checkboxes and radio button form elements stylable with css

##How to use
Just include the forms.js and then you can style each form elements with the following classes:  
.checkbox for a checkbox  
.checkbox.selected for a ticked checkbox  
.radio for a checkbox  
.radio.selected for a ticked checkbox  

Select box styles coming when I think of a nice way to do them easily
